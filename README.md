# Most Memorable Experiences
- The most memorable experience I had this summer was that during my party I got a surprise gift which ended up being a puppy.

# Summer Playlist
- This summer I listened to a playlist with the whole Daisy Jones & The Six soundtrack since I had just finished the book and then became obsessed with their music.
- I also listened to a lot of mexican music because while I was in Mexico it was just played everywhere.

# Favorite Summer Food
- Some of my favorite summer food was tacos and tortas because I ate these meals a lot while I was in Mexico.
- I also ate lots of Mexican chips that are not in America.

# Sports or Physical Activities
- While I was in Mexico I would practice softball with the girls from my community.
- Near the end of July there was also a game that took place agaisnt other girls from a differnet community.

# Family Traditons
- One of the last things that I did before I left Mexico in August was go to a family reunion.
- This family was for the people from my moms side and it was nice to meet people who I had never seen before.
